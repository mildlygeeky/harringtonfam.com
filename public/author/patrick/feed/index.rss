				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On July 12, 2013 at 3:44am, Maggie Teresa Harrington entered into the world, weighing seven pounds, two ounces, and measuring 19 inches.</p>
<p><a href="http://harringtonfam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/uI1lWTq9KLjayWMk1vQ3jTPQs6OUX0xwtqF-nBXbubs.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-60" alt="uI1lWTq9KLjayWMk1vQ3jTPQs6OUX0xwtqF-nBXbubs" src="http://harringtonfam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/uI1lWTq9KLjayWMk1vQ3jTPQs6OUX0xwtqF-nBXbubs-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>Due to complications from preeclampsia, things didn&#8217;t follow our original birth plan and we ended up needing a c-section, however we were just happy to have her arrive happy and healthy!  After 4 days in the hospital, during which time Maggie was already back to her birth weight, we were able to head home.  While it was a long stay, we were so glad to have the extra few nights help from the nurses and felt a lot better by the time we came home and had to figure it out for ourselves.</p>
<p><a href="http://harringtonfam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/vu5_2x1y-H-dvl0143N4Kcs_FFmY9zbkcDfAeAixayU.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-61" alt="vu5_2x1y-H-dvl0143N4Kcs_FFmY9zbkcDfAeAixayU" src="http://harringtonfam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/vu5_2x1y-H-dvl0143N4Kcs_FFmY9zbkcDfAeAixayU-224x300.jpg" width="224" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>As we finish off week two, we&#8217;re starting to get into a groove.  Maggie has been sleeping in 4-5 hour chunks overnight which has helped us to maintain some sanity.  We had a few trying days, but generally she&#8217;s been a happy baby who eats like a champ!  She&#8217;s been busy visiting with her very big family and can&#8217;t wait to meet the rest of them.</p>
<p><a href="http://harringtonfam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/6w38O4BP9vCpnIYUx30PmdVzPT_spv_z_6GypeZUDQU.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-70" alt="6w38O4BP9vCpnIYUx30PmdVzPT_spv_z_6GypeZUDQU" src="http://harringtonfam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/6w38O4BP9vCpnIYUx30PmdVzPT_spv_z_6GypeZUDQU-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>Cara has been recovering well from the c-section and is glad the 2 week driving ban is up!  We&#8217;re all looking forward to nice weather (read &#8211; not 90s or raining) to be able to take Maggie out in her stroller and check out the neighborhood.</p>
