				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="float:left;"><img width="4288" height="2848" src="http://harringtonfam.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC0515.jpg" class="attachment-archive-thumb wp-post-image" alt="_DSC0515" /></div><p>So it all started 10 days earlier&#8230;I spent a night barely sleeping as my whole body was itchier than I had ever experienced.  I put a call in to the doctor who recommended going in for some blood work, hmmm. Monday&#8217;s blood work followed with an appointment Tuesday with my dr.  At this point, we weren&#8217;t sure what was going on, but there was a chance of an issue called obstetric cholestasis and so began the week of stress.  We went back and forth with whether or not there was a need to induce, had more blood work and ultrasounds every other day, all while waiting on ONE test to come back that can take 5-7 days (why any blood test takes that long, I have no idea!).  Finally came the morning of Maggie&#8217;s recital and the day we were due to find out for sure, yes or no on an induction.  A morning call from my doctor said, we&#8217;re in the clear &#8211; we&#8217;ll wait for you to go into labor naturally.  So off we went to Maggie&#8217;s recital relieved that everything was okay.  At intermission, I check my phone and have a voicemail from my doctor &#8220;nothing urgent, but call me when you can&#8221; &#8211; turns out after a day of discussing my case with some other physicians and diving closely into my blood work, they decided I was, in fact, a candidate for an induction and&#8230;could I come in tonight?</p>
<p>We drove Maggie home, put her to bed, packed up the car and headed for the hospital, leaving Maggie with Nana.  At this point, they were happy to induce and see if my body would go into labor itself &#8211; after a C-section with Maggie, I was more than happy to try and avoid that scenario again.</p>
<p>We started the induction and settled in for a long night/few days&#8230;.after about 12 hours, we decided the induction wouldn&#8217;t work, Graeme wasn&#8217;t responding well to the contractions and they didn&#8217;t want to push it, and so a repeat c-section was planned and by 1:31pm on June 13, we welcomed our baby boy!</p>
<p>Introducing Graeme Robert Harrington, weighing 6lbs 11oz and measuring 19 inches, and as scrumptious as they come!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On July 12, 2013 at 3:44am, Maggie Teresa Harrington entered into the world, weighing seven pounds, two ounces, and measuring 19 inches.</p>
<p><a href="http://harringtonfam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/uI1lWTq9KLjayWMk1vQ3jTPQs6OUX0xwtqF-nBXbubs.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-60" alt="uI1lWTq9KLjayWMk1vQ3jTPQs6OUX0xwtqF-nBXbubs" src="http://harringtonfam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/uI1lWTq9KLjayWMk1vQ3jTPQs6OUX0xwtqF-nBXbubs-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>Due to complications from preeclampsia, things didn&#8217;t follow our original birth plan and we ended up needing a c-section, however we were just happy to have her arrive happy and healthy!  After 4 days in the hospital, during which time Maggie was already back to her birth weight, we were able to head home.  While it was a long stay, we were so glad to have the extra few nights help from the nurses and felt a lot better by the time we came home and had to figure it out for ourselves.</p>
<p><a href="http://harringtonfam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/vu5_2x1y-H-dvl0143N4Kcs_FFmY9zbkcDfAeAixayU.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-61" alt="vu5_2x1y-H-dvl0143N4Kcs_FFmY9zbkcDfAeAixayU" src="http://harringtonfam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/vu5_2x1y-H-dvl0143N4Kcs_FFmY9zbkcDfAeAixayU-224x300.jpg" width="224" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>As we finish off week two, we&#8217;re starting to get into a groove.  Maggie has been sleeping in 4-5 hour chunks overnight which has helped us to maintain some sanity.  We had a few trying days, but generally she&#8217;s been a happy baby who eats like a champ!  She&#8217;s been busy visiting with her very big family and can&#8217;t wait to meet the rest of them.</p>
<p><a href="http://harringtonfam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/6w38O4BP9vCpnIYUx30PmdVzPT_spv_z_6GypeZUDQU.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-70" alt="6w38O4BP9vCpnIYUx30PmdVzPT_spv_z_6GypeZUDQU" src="http://harringtonfam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/6w38O4BP9vCpnIYUx30PmdVzPT_spv_z_6GypeZUDQU-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>Cara has been recovering well from the c-section and is glad the 2 week driving ban is up!  We&#8217;re all looking forward to nice weather (read &#8211; not 90s or raining) to be able to take Maggie out in her stroller and check out the neighborhood.</p>
