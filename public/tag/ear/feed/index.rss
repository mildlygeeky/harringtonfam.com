				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes..the title is a bit of a throwback to the 80&#8242;s, but with the recent resurgence of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, I figure it&#8217;s okay!</p>
<p>Since Maggie has started at Little Sprouts there have been a number of positive changes/additions to her daily life, but one big negative has been the sickness.  Every parent I know who had to send their child to daycare has commented on how rough the first winter can be, and after 6 ear infections in 3 months, we understood first hand!  We finally decided to go ahead and have tubes inserted to help avoid any additional infections or potential hearing damage.</p>
<p>Yesterday, we went to Mass Eye and Ear to have the tubes inserted.  We had to arrive by 6 am for a 7:30 operation, lucky for Maggie that meant staying in her pjs!</p>
<p><a href="https://harringtonfam.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_6340.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-221" alt="IMG_6340" src="https://harringtonfam.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_6340-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>Operation went smoothly &#8211; only about 15 minutes of operating and then maybe another 10 before she woke and we were allowed to see her.  The initial waking up from the anesthesia was tough, Maggie cried for about 20 minutes &#8211; which was expected &#8211; it has to be weird to wake up from surgery and have no idea what was going on.  Eventually she fell back to sleep for a bit after much coaxing.</p>
<p><a href="https://harringtonfam.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_6344.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-222" alt="IMG_6344" src="https://harringtonfam.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_6344-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>When she woke up again and the medicine wore off a bit more she was in a much better mood and was allowed to eat again, she hungrily drank down a bottle of water with a bit of apple juice after not getting any breakfast that morning.  Once the nurse was happy that she could keep down fluids we were able to go home around 9:30am.</p>
<p>Why are hospital gowns so ugly on adults but so cute on children!?</p>
<p><a href="https://harringtonfam.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_6346.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-223" alt="IMG_6346" src="https://harringtonfam.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_6346-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Maggie has recovered well and is back to Little Sprouts today &#8211; hopefully this is the end of ear infections for a while.  We&#8217;re all very much looking forward to the end of winter and beginning of spring&#8230;warmer weather, less sickness, outdoor activities, and the Red Sox!</p>
