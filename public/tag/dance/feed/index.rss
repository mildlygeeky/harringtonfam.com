				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="float:left;"><img width="1280" height="960" src="https://harringtonfam.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/IMG_7284-e1466366419268.jpg" class="attachment-archive-thumb wp-post-image" alt="IMG_7284" /></div><p>After attending weekly Saturday morning dance classes since last fall, Maggie&#8217;s first recital was finally here.  I was nervous as to how she would do &#8211; we had talked about going on stage and dancing with her friends, but I was pretty sure she had no idea what that actually entailed.  Rehearsal happened the day before and despite a little trepidation at first, she went out on stage and performed both her dances wonderfully!  Sunday&#8217;s performance included a costume change and having Daddy, Nana, Grandma, and Papa in the audience as well &#8211; and once again, she did great!  Enjoy below!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atjq3pjjSqc&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">Ballet</a> (this once was a little shakier&#8230;though they only spent about 10 minutes at the end of each class on ballet, and the distractions on stage are pretty entertaining!)</p>
<p>Despite a week of being unsure as to whether or not we (specifically I) would be able to even make the recital (see <a title="Graeme has arrived!" href="https://harringtonfam.com/2016/06/graeme-has-arrived/" target="_blank">Graeme has arrived!</a>) &#8211; I was so proud and excited to be able to cheer on our little girl who doesn&#8217;t seem so little these days!</p>
