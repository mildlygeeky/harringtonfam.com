				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="float:left;"><img width="1080" height="1531" src="http://harringtonfam.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_4996-e1478180424130.jpg" class="attachment-archive-thumb wp-post-image" alt="img_4996" /></div><p>Ahead of Tuesday&#8217;s election, I want to get this out.  I know this blog doesn&#8217;t get much traffic, but I hope one day when Maggie and Graeme are older, they appreciate the photos and posts to tell them about our life (printed photo albums are far too hard to keep up with, and that baby book I never filled in&#8230;yea&#8230;).  So for them, and all the kids out there who are too young to vote but who&#8217;s lives will be forever affected by the results of this election, here&#8217;s why I&#8217;m with Hillary.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m with her&#8230;because raising human beings is hard enough without having to explain why our president is allowed to name call.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m with her&#8230;because parents deserve to have paid leave to take care of a new baby, an aging parent, or a sick kid.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m with her&#8230;because immigrants make our country a better place and should be welcomed with open arms.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m with her&#8230;because getting sick should not put you into bankruptcy.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m with her&#8230;because women deserve the right to makes their own decisions about their own bodies.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m with her&#8230;because we need Supreme Court justices who will continue to protect the lives and interests of women, minorities, LGBTQ, and other under-represented populations.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m with her&#8230;because education is one of the most important things we can give the next generation, and we need to do better.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m with her&#8230;because I&#8217;m an ally who believes that you should be able to love whoever you want, be whoever you want, and live the life you choose.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m with her&#8230;because women work just as hard (sometimes harder) than their male counterparts and should be compensated equally.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m with her&#8230;because my vision of America is a united one, one where our differences raise us up rather than tearing us apart.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m with her&#8230;because I believe in science, climate change is real, and we need to power our lives in ways that are more efficient, effective, and better for the environment.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m with her&#8230;because she is the MOST qualified person to ever run for office and will continue to push our country forward.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m with her&#8230;because &#8220;Madam President&#8221; should be a term used so frequently, it&#8217;s no longer novel.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m with her&#8230;because not just our daughters, but our sons, need to live in a country where a woman can rise to the highest office to show them that women can and should do whatever they want in life.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m with her&#8230;because LOVE should always trump hate.</p>
