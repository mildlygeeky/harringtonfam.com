				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since 1988, October has been Pregnancy and Infant Loss Awareness Month &#8211; I never really gave it much thought, both the getting pregnant and full pregnancy with Maggie had gone as smoothly as we could hope (until the final weeks at least!) that I wasn&#8217;t worried. Then came spring 2015. We had decided it was about time for #2 and once again, I got pregnant. A trip to my OB confirmed things and we began the planning&#8230;will we find out the gender? how will Maggie adjust? We&#8217;ll need to clear out the office&#8230;</p>
<p>Soon it was time for my next check up with my OB, around 9 weeks when we should be able to hear the heartbeat for the first time. Sadly, there wasn&#8217;t one. A quick scan confirmed that the baby had stopped growing 2 weeks prior. The next few days were a blur as we had a D&amp;C and attempted to process the news.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, my story is not unique, but when it first happened, it felt that way. As I shared my news with close friends and family, I quickly realized how common it can be, though not often talked about. I&#8217;m sharing this now, having had plenty of time to grieve and having made it through my subsequent pregnancy, to let others know &#8211; you&#8217;re not alone. It&#8217;s a horrible thing to experience, but there&#8217;s light on the other side.</p>
<p>So while there will always be some amount of &#8220;what if&#8217;s&#8221;, looking at Graeme now, I can&#8217;t imagine life without him.  I do believe that some things happen for a reason, and luckily, I have two beautiful, healthy kids to remember that rainbows only come after the rain.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="float:left;"><img width="4288" height="2848" src="https://harringtonfam.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC0515.jpg" class="attachment-archive-thumb wp-post-image" alt="_DSC0515" /></div><p>So it all started 10 days earlier&#8230;I spent a night barely sleeping as my whole body was itchier than I had ever experienced.  I put a call in to the doctor who recommended going in for some blood work, hmmm. Monday&#8217;s blood work followed with an appointment Tuesday with my dr.  At this point, we weren&#8217;t sure what was going on, but there was a chance of an issue called obstetric cholestasis and so began the week of stress.  We went back and forth with whether or not there was a need to induce, had more blood work and ultrasounds every other day, all while waiting on ONE test to come back that can take 5-7 days (why any blood test takes that long, I have no idea!).  Finally came the morning of Maggie&#8217;s recital and the day we were due to find out for sure, yes or no on an induction.  A morning call from my doctor said, we&#8217;re in the clear &#8211; we&#8217;ll wait for you to go into labor naturally.  So off we went to Maggie&#8217;s recital relieved that everything was okay.  At intermission, I check my phone and have a voicemail from my doctor &#8220;nothing urgent, but call me when you can&#8221; &#8211; turns out after a day of discussing my case with some other physicians and diving closely into my blood work, they decided I was, in fact, a candidate for an induction and&#8230;could I come in tonight?</p>
<p>We drove Maggie home, put her to bed, packed up the car and headed for the hospital, leaving Maggie with Nana.  At this point, they were happy to induce and see if my body would go into labor itself &#8211; after a C-section with Maggie, I was more than happy to try and avoid that scenario again.</p>
<p>We started the induction and settled in for a long night/few days&#8230;.after about 12 hours, we decided the induction wouldn&#8217;t work, Graeme wasn&#8217;t responding well to the contractions and they didn&#8217;t want to push it, and so a repeat c-section was planned and by 1:31pm on June 13, we welcomed our baby boy!</p>
<p>Introducing Graeme Robert Harrington, weighing 6lbs 11oz and measuring 19 inches, and as scrumptious as they come!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="float:left;"><img width="3495" height="2330" src="https://harringtonfam.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/MaggieFinals-5693-2.jpg" class="attachment-archive-thumb wp-post-image" alt="MaggieFinals-5693-2" /></div><p>We&#8217;re less than 5 weeks from the due date for Baby Boy Harrington and we&#8217;re all getting ready.  Maggie loves to &#8220;listen&#8221; to my belly and tell me things like &#8220;the new baby says he wants to come out&#8221; or put her finger in my belly button and giggle that the baby is tickling her &#8211; it&#8217;s all really sweet and quite a change from her <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cvanheest/videos/10101591808295227/?permPage=1" target="_blank">initial reaction</a>!  As excited as she has become, I know she has NO idea what is really coming and how different life will be, but I know in the long run it&#8217;ll be worth the initial struggles to have a sibling, a friend for life.</p>
<p>Although I didn&#8217;t bother when pregnant with Maggie, we decided to do some maternity photos this time round &#8211; mainly because I wanted to capture some last photos before we became a family of 4.  We used <a href="lyndsayhannahphotography.com" target="_blank">Lyndsay Hannah Photography</a> who I can&#8217;t say enough about! She is a friend of a friend who, despite only doing this for a short time professionally, is super talented &#8211; plus a really sweet person, which always helps!  Maggie had a blast and Elm Bank in Wellesley is going to be a new destination for us &#8211; their <a href="https://www.masshort.org/Weezie-s-Garden-for-Children" target="_blank">children&#8217;s garden</a> was amazing.  Here are a few favorites!</p>
